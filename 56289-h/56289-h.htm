  <h2 class='c003'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It has long been a matter of surprize
to those who are interested in the
education of youth, that, among the numerous
publications intended for their
improvement, so few attempts have been
made to facilitate the study of Astronomy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many excellent treatises have been
written on this important and useful
science; but if it be considered that they
abound with technical terms, unintelligible
to juvenile minds, it cannot be expected
that they should derive any great
advantage from the perusal of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>To remove these difficulties, the Author
has endeavoured, whenever he had occasion
to use them, to give such illustrations
as to leave no doubt on the young student’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>mind respecting their true meaning.</p>

<p class='c009'>The subject appeared to him to be best
calculated for dialogues, which are certainly
more agreeable as well as more
perspicuous to young persons, than the
discouraging formality of a treatise. And
it is presumed the language will be found
natural and easy.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the order he has chosen, he has been
careful not to introduce any thing new, till
the former part, on which it depends, has
been clearly explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the whole, it has been his aim to
render it as concise and plain as the nature
of the subject will admit; and he
flatters himself, that at a time when the
sciences are so universally studied, the introduction
now offered to the public will
not be unacceptable.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c009'>Well, Sir! I suppose this early
visit is in consequence of my
promise, and your anxiety to become an
astronomer.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is, Sir.—And as astronomy
is a science of which I have a very imperfect
idea, I must beg of you to explain it
to me.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> That I shall do with pleasure.
But you surely cannot wholly
forget what I have formerly told you.
However, as I mean to treat the subject
as if you had no previous knowledge of
it, you will have an opportunity from
what you can recollect, to make such
remarks, and ask such questions, as may
appear most material to you.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I thank you, Sir, it is just
what I wish.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> By astronomy then is meant
a knowledge of the heavenly bodies, the
sun, moon, planets, comets, and stars,
respecting their nature, magnitudes, distances,
motions, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I fear I shall find it a difficult
study.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Have patience.——</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This gives me encouragement,
and, if you will have patience with me,
I will endeavour to profit by your instructions.——Pray,
Sir, what is the sun?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The sun, the source of light
and heat, has been considered a globe
of fire, round which seven other spherical
bodies revolve at different distances
from him, and in different periods of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>time, from west by south to east. These
are the planets<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Any round ball is a globe, is
it not?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> A sphere or globe is defined
a round solid body, every part of
whose surface is equally distant from a point
within called its center; and a line drawn
from one side through the center to the
opposite side, is called its diameter.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> You say the sun has been considered
a globe of fire. Is he not now
thought to be so?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> <a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a>Doctor Herschell, from some
late observations, is of a different opinion.—But
what think you of his magnitude?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I really cannot conjecture.—This
I know, that when I saw him
through the fog the other day, he appeared
about the size of a common
plate.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You must not always judge
by appearances. You will find that there
is a material difference between his real
and apparent magnitude, which I think
you will be convinced of when I tell you,
that he is no less than 95 millions of
miles from our earth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Ninety-five millions of miles!
You astonish me.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You will, I dare say, be no
less surprized at being told, that he is
more than a million of times as large as
our earth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is almost incredible! And
what are the planets?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The planets are opaque, that
is dark bodies, which receive their light
from the sun; and, as I told you, revolve
about him. The first, or that nearest
the sun, is called Mercury, the next Venus,
then the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
and Georgian, or the Georgium Sidus.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
These are called primary planets.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Are there then any others?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Yes. There are fourteen
others, which move round their respective
primaries as their centers, and with
them round the sun, and are called secondaries,
satellites or moons.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Have all the primaries secondaries?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Only four of them have
moons. The earth, I need not tell you,
has one; Jupiter has four; Saturn seven,
besides a stupendous ring which surrounds
his body; and Georgian two.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> In what time, and at what distances,
from the sun, do the planets perform
their periodical revolutions?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> <i>Mercury</i> revolves about the
sun in 88 days, at the distance of 36 millions
of miles.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Venus</i>, at the distance of 68 millions of
miles, completes her revolution in 224
days.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Earth</i>, on which we live, at the distance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>of 95 millions of miles, performs
its period in one year.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><i>Mars</i>, at the distance of 145 millions
of miles, in little less than two of our
years.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Jupiter</i>, at the distance of 494 millions
of miles, in near 12 years.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Saturn</i>, at the distance of 906 millions
of miles, in about 30 years.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Georgian</i>, discovered a few years since
by Dr. Herschell, performs its period at
the distance of 1812 millions of miles, in
about 83 years.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What proportion does the
earth bear in magnitude to the other
planets?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The earth is fourteen times as
large as Mercury, very little larger than
Venus, and three times as large as Mars.
But Jupiter is more than fourteen hundred
times as large as the earth; Saturn
above a thousand times as large, exclusive
of his ring; and Georgian eighty-two
times as large.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Have you any thing else, Sir,
to remark concerning the planets?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> There are several other things
I intend to make you acquainted with,
namely, their nature, appearances, motions,
&amp;c. At present I shall only say,
that Mercury and Venus are called <a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a>inferior
planets, their orbits or paths described
in going round the sun, being within that
of the earth; and the other four, whose
orbits are without the earth’s orbit, <a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a>superior
planets.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> There is one thing more I wish
to know, if——</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I suppose you were going to
say if not too much trouble; that is quite
unnecessary, as you well know that where
I see a desire to learn, teaching is to me
a pleasure.—What is it?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That you will be so kind as to
inform me what the comets are, and if
they have any motion?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The knowledge we have of
comets is very imperfect, as they afford
few observations on which to ground conjecture.
They are generally supposed to
be planetary bodies, forming a part of
our system: for, like the planets, they revolve
about the sun, but in different directions,
and in extremely long elliptic
curves, being sometimes near the sun, at
others staying far beyond the orbit of the
outermost planet; whereas the orbits of
the planets are nearly circular. The period
of one, which appeared in 1680, is
computed to be 575 years.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Whence do they derive their
name?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> From <i>Cometa</i>, a <i>hairy star</i>, because
they appear with long tails, somewhat
resembling hair: some, however,
have been seen without this appendage,
as well defined and round as planets.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> You say <i>our</i> system: what am
I to understand by it?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The word system, in an astronomical
sense, means a number of bodies
moving round one common center or
point: and, because the planets and comets
revolve about the sun, it is called
the <i>Solar System</i> (Plate I. fig. 2.); and
we say <i>our</i> system, as the earth is one of
the planets. Other systems have been
invented for solving the appearances and
motions of the heavenly bodies, a description
of which I shall leave till I next
see you.</p>

four of such parts from the sun, Venus at seven, the

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c009'>I am afraid, Sir, I am come before
you are prepared for me: but the
very great pleasure I received yesterday,
induced me to be with you as early as
possible.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I am glad to see you, and
happy to find you are so well pleased with
your difficult study. It will, I assure you,
give you more exalted ideas of the Deity
than any that I know of. The Psalmist
was undoubtedly of this opinion when he
said, The Heavens declare the glory of
God, and the Firmament sheweth his
handy work.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I will no longer call it a difficult,
but a pleasing study, and feel myself
ashamed at having used the expression.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>I shall now beg you to explain to me the
different systems.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The system I have been describing
to you was known and taught
by Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher, who
flourished about 500 years before Christ,
as he found it impossible, in any other
way, to give a consistent account of the
heavenly motions.</p>

<p class='c009'>This system, however, was so extremely
opposite to all the prejudices of sense and
opinion, that it never made any great
progress, nor was ever widely spread in
the ancient world.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ptolemy, an Egyptian philosopher,
who flourished 130 years after Christ,
supposed that the earth was fixed in the
center, and that the sun and the rest of the
heavenly bodies moved round it in twenty-four
hours, or one natural day, as this
seemed to correspond with the sensible
appearances of the cœlestial motions.
This system was maintained from the
time of Ptolemy to the revival of learning
in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>At length, Copernicus, a native of
Poland, a bold and original genius,
adopted the Pythagorean system, and
published it to the world in the year
1530. This doctrine had been so long
in obscurity, that the restorer of it was
considered as the inventor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Europe, however, was still immersed
in ignorance; and the general ideas of
the world were not able to keep pace with
those of a refined philosophy. This occasioned
Copernicus to have few abettors,
but many opponents. Tycho Brahe, in
particular, a noble Dane, sensible of the
defects of the Ptolemaic system, but unwilling
to acknowledge the motion of
the earth, endeavoured, about 1586, to
establish a new system of his own; but,
as this proved to be still more absurd
than that of Ptolemy, it was soon exploded,
and gave way to the <a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a>Copernican
or true Solar System.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I confess, I should have thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>with Ptolemy, that the earth was in the
center, and that the sun moved round it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You must at present content
yourself with knowing that it is not so;
and it shall be my business to prove it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> May I beg the favour of the
information you intended respecting the
planets?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I will grant it with pleasure.
The planets are spherical bodies, which
appear like stars, but are not luminous;
that is, they have no light in themselves;
though they give us light; for they shine
by reflecting the light of the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> You say, Sir, that they appear
like stars; if so, how am I to know them
from stars?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Very easily: for the stars, or
as they are more properly called fixed
stars, always keep the same situation with
respect to each other; whereas the planets,
as they move round the sun, must be continually
changing their places among the
fixed stars, and with one another.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Is there any other method of
distinguishing them besides what you have
mentioned?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Yes. The planets never
twinkle like the fixed stars, and are seen
earliest in the evening and latest in the
morning.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> How is the twinkling of the
stars in a clear night accounted for?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It arises from the continual
agitation of the air or atmosphere through
which we view them; the particles of air
being always in motion, will cause a
twinkling in any distant luminous body,
which shines with a strong light.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Then, I suppose, the planets
not being luminous, is the reason why they
do not twinkle.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Most certainly. The feeble
light with which they shine is not sufficient
to cause such an appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Have the stars then light in
themselves?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> They undoubtedly shine with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>their own native light, or we should not
see even the nearest of them: the distance
being so immensely great, that if a
cannon-ball were to travel from it to the
sun, with the same velocity with which it
left the cannon, it would be more than
1 million, 868 thousand years, before it
reached it.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This is wonderful indeed! what
then are they supposed to be?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Suns.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Suns! the fixed stars suns!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I am almost lost.—I used to

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> This is a vulgar error.—They

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> How do you know they are

their being so?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> No. But we know that the
sun shines with his own light on all the
planets belonging to our system; and from
what I have told you, have the greatest
reason to believe that the stars shine with
their own light: we therefore from analogy

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This I well remember.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Indeed, I cannot tell.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You surely cannot imagine
that they were intended for our use, since
we knew nothing of them till after the invention
of telescopes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That is what I think no one
can suppose.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And do not all the planets enjoy
the benefit of the sun in common
with us?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Undoubtedly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Well, then; of what use
would the light and heat be which is conveyed
to them from the sun; or the light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>which they receive from their moons if
there are no inhabitants?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I know of none.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Can you then have any doubt
about their being inhabited?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> No, Sir.—But you say that the
stars are suns, each of which is the center
of a system of planets or worlds.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If you are satisfied that the
planets belonging to our system are inhabited,
and that the fixed stars are suns,
the centers of other systems, what reasonable
objection can you have to all the
planets in the universe being so?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is what I cannot comprehend.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It may be so.—But is not the
same Almighty Power, who does nothing
in vain, as capable of making ten thousand
worlds if he pleased, as well as one?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I will not presume to dispute
his power; but are we not told that all
mankind descended from Adam?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Yes; Moses wrote concerning
this earth, he has not made us acquainted

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c009'>I recollect, Sir, you mentioned last
night, that the planets appear like
stars. Our earth is a planet; how can it
have the appearance of a star?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If you were on the planet
Venus, the earth would have as much the
appearance of a star as Venus has to us.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> But Venus appears amongst
the fixed stars.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Yes. And so would the earth
appear from Venus.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> How can it be?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Because, in whatever part of
the universe we are, we appear to be in
the center of a concave, that is hollow,
sphere, where remote objects appear at
equal distances from us: so that, whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>we are on the planet Venus or on the
earth, in this particular the effect will be
the same.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Then the light <i>we</i> receive from
the sun is by reflection conveyed to the
other planets.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> No doubt of it. And our
earth appears as a moon to the inhabitants
of the moon, and undergoes the various
changes of that planet.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Have you any proof of this,
Sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Nothing can be clearer; for,
on a fine evening, soon after the change
of the moon, when the earth appears
nearly as a full moon to the moon, and
we see a faint streak of light, the whole
body of the moon is visible to us.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I remember to have seen it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You do?—The earth then
will appear there thirteen times as large
as the moon does to us; of course it must
reflect a strong light on the body of the
moon, and it is by that light we see that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>part of the moon which is turned from
the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Is the earth, then, only thirteen
times as big as the moon?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> In solidity it is about fifty
times as large; but its disc or face is only
thirteen times.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What is the moon’s distance
from the earth?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> 240 thousand miles, which is
about 400 times less than that of the
sun.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> And yet she appears as far
distant as the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You are now, I hope, convinced
of what I said relative to distant
objects.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I am, Sir: and I suppose the
reason of the moon’s appearing as large as
the sun, is because she is so much nearer
to us.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is so.—For, at a total
eclipse of the sun, which happens when
the moon is in a right line between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>sun and the earth, the sun is obscured
from our sight, although his disc is 160
thousand times as large as that of the
moon. In like manner would the moon,
when at full, be hid by placing your
cricket-ball in a line between your eye
and her, yet, you know, the ball is not so
large as the moon; but being nearer the
eye, it is apparently so.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This is very clear. But——</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I conjecture you were going
to ask me to explain the nature of
eclipses.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That was certainly my intention,
Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> There are other things you
must be made acquainted with before you
will be able to comprehend it, and which
I will endeavour to make you understand
before we enter on the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Whenever you please, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You have taken a view of
the earth from the planet Venus.—Suppose
I transport you to one of the planets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>belonging to another system; what description
do you think you should give of
it?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I must consider. What I now
call a star would be a sun. The planets
of that system I should see as I now do
those belonging to ours: our sun would
be a star; and the earth, with all the
other planets, would be invisible.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Very well, Sir. Can you
then find it difficult to conceive that all
the stars are as far from each other in
unbounded space as our sun is from the
nearest star?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is hard to conceive: but
when I consider that wherever I am,
every remote object appears at an equal
distance from me, the difficulty vanishes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> That you might form some
idea of the immense distance of the fixed
stars, you must recollect, I mentioned
the time a cannon-ball would be in reaching
the nearest of them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I do, Sir. More than 1,868,000
years.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You have an excellent memory.
I suppose then you know the
distance of the earth from the sun?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Yes, Sir. I wrote it down;
and, it made so strong an impression on
my memory, that I believe I shall never
forget it.—95 millions of miles.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Now, suppose the earth to be
in that part of its orbit which is nearest
to the star, it would be 95 millions of
miles nearer to it than the sun is.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And, in the opposite side of
its orbit, as much farther from the star.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Without doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Then you find that the earth
is 190 millions of miles nearer to the star
at one time of the year than it is at another;
and yet the magnitude of the star
does not appear the least altered, nor is its
distance affected by it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> A proof of its amazing distance.—I
was going to ask a silly question.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> What is it? perhaps not so
simple as you may imagine.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Whether the most conspicuous
stars are not supposed to be the nearest to
us?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Undoubtedly.—And are called
stars of the first magnitude; the next
in splendor, stars of the second magnitude;
and so on to the sixth magnitude;
and those beyond, which are not visible
to the naked eye, are called telescopic
stars.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> The distance of the telescopic
stars must be great indeed, beyond all
conception.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You judge rightly; and their
numbers are beyond all computation.
Doctor Herschell says, he has not a doubt
but that the broad circle in the heavens,
called the Milky Way, is a most extensive
stratum of stars, he having discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>in it many thousands. Besides,
some stars appear to him double, others
treble, &amp;c. not that they are really so,
but are stars at different distances from
us, which appear nearly in a right line.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I have heard of numbering
the stars; but that, I find, is impossible.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If you mean that immense host
of stars I have been describing, it is impossible;
but, though in a clear winter’s
night, without moonshine, they seem to
be innumerable, which is owing to their
strong sparkling, and our looking at them
in a confused manner; yet when the whole
firmament is divided as it has been done
by the ancients, the number that can be
seen at a time, by the naked eye, is not
above a thousand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Pray, Sir, how did the ancients
divide the firmament?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I would willingly answer

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c009'>The ancients, in reducing astronomy
to a science, combined the fixed
stars into constellations, allowing several
stars to make one constellation: and, for
the better distinguishing and observing
them, they reduced the constellations to
the forms of animals, or to the images of
some known things, by which means they
were enabled to signify to others any particular
star they meant to notice. Job
mentions two of the constellations, namely,
Orion and Pleiades, which shews the
study of astronomy to be very ancient.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Pray, Sir, how may I know
them?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> By studying the use of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>cælestial globe, on which they are
drawn.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Will you be kind enough to
instruct me, Sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> At some future time I probably
may: at present you are not prepared
for it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I am satisfied.—Have you
any thing more to remark of the constellations,
Sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Yes. The situation of the
planets, as they are continually changing
their places, could not be pointed out
without first dividing the stars into constellations:
hence, necessity was the mother
of invention.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> And I think a very ingenious
one.—If I may be allowed a comparison, I
will suppose the different kingdoms of the
world on my dissected map, to represent
so many constellations; then, if I hear of
London, I know it is in England; if of
Paris, in France; of Lisbon, in Portugal;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and so on. These I would compare
with stars of the first magnitude, being
the chief cities of their respective kingdoms;
inferior cities, stars of the second
magnitude; principal towns of the third,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> A very apt comparison indeed.
Now if you hear of a traveller setting off
from London to Dover, thence to Calais,
Paris, Bern, and so on to Rome,
you know that he must go through part
of England, Flanders, France, Switzerland,
and Italy, passing many towns and
villages on his way.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That is very evident.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Very well, then; in like manner
would the planets, if seen from the
sun, be traced from star to star, from constellation
to constellation, through their
whole periods.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is not possible to view them
from the sun, surely, is it?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> No, certainly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Why then do you say if seen
from the sun?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Because it is there only their
motions can appear uniform; as seen
from the earth they apparently move very
irregularly.—Suppose you were in the
center of a circular course; and, whilst a
horse was going round, you kept your
eye on him: cannot you conceive that
you should see him run round the course
in a regular manner, moving the whole
time the same way?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is not at all difficult to conceive.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Again. Imagine yourself
placed at a considerable distance on the
outside of the course, where you could
see the horse the whole time he was going
round, would he appear to move as
uniformly as before?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Certainly not: on the opposite
side of the course his motion would be
the same as when I stood in the center
of it; when he was approaching me, I
should scarcely see him move; in that
part of the course next to me he would
move in a direction contrary to what he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>did at first; and again when going from
me, his motion would be scarcely visible.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> This I think will give you a
tolerable idea of the irregular motion
of the inferior planets, as seen from the
earth. When farthest from us their motion
is said to be direct; when nearest to
us retrograde, because they appear to be
moving back again; and, when approaching,
or going from us, we say they
are stationary; because, if then observed
in a line with any particular star, they will
continue so for a considerable time: now
these appearances could not happen if
they moved round the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Nothing can be plainer: for
if the earth were in the center we should
always see them move the same way.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> When the planet is nearest to
us, that is in a line between us and the
sun, we say it is in its inferior conjunction;
when farthest from us, and the
sun is between us and the planet, in its superior
conjunction. But the superior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>planets have alternately a conjunction and
an opposition.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> A conjunction, I suppose, when
the sun is between the earth and the planet,
and an opposition when the earth is
between the sun and the planet; that is,
when the planet is nearest to us, and appears
to be opposite to the sun?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You are right.—Therefore,
when in conjunction it rises and sets,
nearly with the sun; but in opposition,
it rises nearly when the sun sets, and sets
when he rises.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Why do you say nearly, Sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Because it cannot be exactly,
but when the sun, earth, and planet are
in a <i>right</i> line, which seldom happens.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> How do you account for this,
Sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> At present I fear you will not
be able to comprehend what I wish to explain,
as I must use a term you are unacquainted
with. The reason is, that the
planets are very seldom in or near their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>nodes at their conjunctions or oppositions.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I do not indeed understand
what you mean by the word <i>nodes</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It will be explained to you in
due time, and I shall conclude this evening
with a few more remarks relative to
the appearance of the planets.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Any thing you please, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You know that the planets,
being opaque bodies, receive their light
from the sun; and that only that part
which is turned to the sun can be enlightened
by him, whilst the opposite side
must remain in darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This is self-evident: if I hold
my ball to the candle it will have the
same effect.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Tell me then how you think
they will appear as seen from the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> If, when you shewed me Venus,
she had not appeared perfectly round, I
should say that, both before and after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>her superior conjunction I should see
her nearly with a full face; when stationary,
only half enlightened, like the moon
at first quarter; because, an equal portion
of the dark and bright parts will be
turned towards us; the bright part will
be decreasing till her inferior conjunction,
when the dark side will be turned towards
us, and consequently invisible;
the light will then increase; and, when
she is again stationary, she will appear
like the moon at last quarter.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> When seen through a telescope
she has the different appearances you have
mentioned; and when I next see you I
will shew you that both Venus and Mercury
may sometimes be seen when in
their inferior conjunctions; the superior
planets always appear with nearly a full
face.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> How are the planets distinguished
from each other?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> <i>Mercury</i>, from his vicinity to
the sun, is seldom seen, being lost in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>splendor of the solar brightness. When
seen, he emits a very bright white light.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Venus</i>, known by the names of the
morning and evening star, is the brightest,
and to appearance, the largest of all the
planets; her light is of a white colour,
and so considerable, that in a dusky place
she projects a sensible shade. She is visible
only for three or four hours in the
morning or evening, according as she is
before or after the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Mars</i> is the least bright of all the
planets. He appears of a dusky reddish
hue, and much larger at some periods
than at others, according as he is nearer
to, or farther from us.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Jupiter</i> is distinguished by his peculiar
magnitude and light. To the naked eye
he appears almost as large as Venus, but
not altogether so bright.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Saturn</i> shines but with a pale feeble
light, less bright than Jupiter, though less
ruddy than Mars.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span><i>The Georgium Sidus</i> cannot be readily
perceived without the assistance of a telescope.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c009'>Before I proceed to explain what
I promised you, it is necessary you
should be informed that the earth as seen
from the sun, in its periodical revolutions,
will describe a circle among the stars
which astronomers call the <i>ecliptic</i>, and
sometimes <i>the sun’s annual path</i>, because
the sun, as seen from the earth, always
appears in that line.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Do not all the planets move
in the ecliptic?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> No.—On account of the
obliquity of their orbits, they are, in
every revolution, one half of their periods
above the ecliptic, and the other
half below it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I think I comprehend your
meaning; but shall be obliged to you,
Sir, if you can make it clearer to me.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I have here a little design,
(Plate II. Fig. 1.) which will answer
our purpose: where S represents the sun;
ABCD, the orbit of the earth; and
EFGH, the orbit of one of the inferior
planets, suppose Venus.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/plate-2.jpg' alt='Plate II' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Now I understand it perfectly:
the half EHG rises above, and
the other half EFG sinks below it, from
the points EG, which I perceive are in
a line with the orbit of the earth. But
pray, Sir, have you any name for that
dotted line?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Yes, it is called the <i>line</i>
of the nodes; and the points EG the
<i>nodes</i> of the planet: the latter is called
the ascending node, because, when the
planet is in G, it is ascending or rising
above the orbit of the earth; or, which
is the same thing, above the ecliptic: and
when in E, it is descending or sinking below
it, whence <i>it</i> is called the descending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>node. But you must remember that the
orbits of all the planets do not cross or intersect
the ecliptic in the same points;
but that their nodes or intersections are at
different parts of it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> How can the orbit of the earth
and the ecliptic be the same?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> They are very different; but
being in the same plane, if the orbit of
any planet inclines to one it must incline
equally to the other.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> You will, I fear, Sir, think me
very stupid: but I must beg of you to
inform me what you mean by a plane?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Any flat surface is a plane.
You may therefore suppose the edge of a
round tea-table to represent the ecliptic,
and a circle within it, drawn from the
center of the table, the orbit of the earth:
will they not be both in the same plane?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You must not imagine, when
I am speaking to you of the plane of the
ecliptic, or plane of the earth’s orbit, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>it is a visible flat surface, or, in speaking
of the orbits of the planets, I mean solid
rings.—No. The planets perform their
revolutions with the utmost regularity, in
unbounded space; and, like a bird thro’
the air, leave no track behind them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> How then are they retained in
their orbits?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The question, I confess, is
natural, and is what I expected; but I
must of necessity postpone it to another
opportunity; and shall now fulfil the promise
I made of shewing you in what
manner the inferior planets may be seen
when in their inferior conjunctions. Cast
your eye again on the little design I gave
you, and consider, if Venus were in her
ascending node at G, when the earth is at
<i>b</i>; or, in her descending node, at E, when
the earth is at <i>a</i>, what the effect would
be.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> She would be in a line with
the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And, on the sun’s disc, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>would appear a dark round spot, passing
over it. These appearances, which are
called transits, happen very seldom: because
she is very seldom in or near her
nodes at her inferior conjunctions. There
was one in June 1761, one in June 1769;
and the next will be in the year 1874.
And as Mercury is seen in the same manner,
it is a proof that their orbits must be
within that of the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I thank you, Sir, and shall be
obliged to you to inform me how many
constellations the earth pastes over in
every revolution?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Twelve, which correspond
with the months of the year, and are called
the twelve signs of the zodiac.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What is the zodiac?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> That part of the heavens
which contains the twelve signs, and which
you may conceive to be a zone or belt
extending eight degrees on each side the
ecliptic, in which the planets constantly
revolve: so that no planet is ever seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>more than eight degrees either north or
south, that is above or below the ecliptic.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What am I to understand by a
degree?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> All circles, whether great or
small, are supposed to be divided into 360
equal parts, called degrees, and each degree
into 60 equal parts, called minutes:
therefore, if I speak of a circle in the
heavens, the circumference of the earth,
or any other circle, by a degree is meant
the 360th part of that circle; and a minute
the 60th part of a degree.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What are the names of the
twelve signs?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The first is called Aries,
which you know signifies a Ram; Taurus,
the Bull; Gemini, the Twins; Cancer,
the Crab; Leo, the Lion; Virgo, the
Virgin; Libra, the Balance; Scorpio, the
Scorpion; Sagittarius, the Archer; Capricorn,
the Goat; Aquarius, the Water-bearer;
and Pisces, the Fishes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Do you wish me to commit
these to memory, Sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is very requisite; but as I
know you are fond of verse, you shall hear
what Doctor Watts says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Ram, the Bull, the heav’nly Twins,</div>
      <div class='line'>And next the Crab the Lion shines,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Virgin, and the Scales:</div>
      <div class='line'>The Scorpion, Archer, and Sea-goat,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Man that holds the Water-pot,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And Fish with glitt’ring tails.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I like it much, as it will assist
my memory.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> As the twelve signs correspond
with the months of the year, the
earth must pass over nearly one degree
every day, one sign every month, and in
twelve months complete a whole circle,
or 360 degrees; therefore every sign
must contain 30 degrees, because 30 multiplied
by 12 is equal to 360.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It must be so.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You must remember, that
when the earth is in any sign, as seen from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the sun, the sun will be in the opposite
sign, as seen from the earth: for instance,
if the earth be in Aries, the sun will be in
Libra; if in Taurus, the sun will be in
Scorpio, &amp;c. therefore, as by the earth’s
annual motion, the sun <i>appears</i> to move,
we always speak of the sun’s, not the
earth’s place, in the ecliptic.—You do
not seem to understand me?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Not perfectly, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Take this orange, and put it
in the middle of the round table before
us, and place an apple on the opposite
side next the window: the orange may
represent the sun, the apple the earth,
and the window the sign Aries. Now
go round the table to the apple; look at
the orange, and tell me to what part of
the room the eye will be directed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> To the part opposite to the
window, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If then you suppose the door,
which is opposite to the window, to be
the sign Libra, the sun will be in Libra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>when the earth is in Aries—will it
not?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is very plain.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I shall now give you a table of
the signs, their characters, the corresponding
months, and the days of the month
the sun enters each sign, by means of
which, if you reckon a degree for a day,
you may find the sun’s place, nearly, for
any day in the year.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This will give me much pleasure,
and I shall be happy to have it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Why do you write northern
and southern signs, Sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Because they are situated north
and south of a circle in the heavens, called
the equinoctial, which circle crosses
the ecliptic in the points Aries and Libra,
and extends 23-1/2 degrees on each side
of it; and which I shall have occasion to
mention to you another time.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> When you think proper, Sir,
I shall be glad to have it explained to
me.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Look at your table, and tell
me what sign and what degree the sun
is in the 30th of March, and 20th of October.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> The sun enters Aries the 20th
of March, of course he must be 10 degrees
in that sign the 30th; and, as he does
not enter Scorpio till the 23d of October,
he must want three degrees of completing
the sign Libra; he must therefore, on
the 20th of October, be in 27 degrees of
Libra.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c009'>Since I was last with you, Sir, I
have been thinking of what you then
told me, that the planets perform their
revolutions in open space: I have not
the least idea how this can be; if convenient,
I shall be happy to have it explained.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It will be necessary first to
inform you, that the orbits or paths described
by the revolution of the planets
round the sun, are not true circles (as Plate
II. fig. 2.) but somewhat elliptical, that
is, longer one way than the other, as
fig. 3.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This is exceedingly plain.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> In a circle, the periphery or
circumference is equally distant from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>point within called its center, as A; but
an ellipsis has two points called the
focuses or foci, as B C. In one of
these, called its lower focus, is the sun:
so that you see in every revolution of the
planet it must be nearer to the sun in
one part of its orbit, than it is in another.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I see it clearly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Now let S (Plate II. fig. 4.)
represent the sun, A B C D a planet in
different parts of its orbit; when it is
nearest to the sun, as at A it is said to
be in its <i>perihelion</i>; when at B its <i>aphelion</i>;
but when at C or D its middle or
mean distance, because the distance S C
or S D is the middle between A S the
least and B S the greatest distance; and
half the distance between the two focuses
is called the <i>eccentricity</i> of its orbit, as S E
or E F.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This I will endeavour to understand;
but I find it will take me some
time to be perfected in it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You may study it at your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>leisure, as it will not prevent our proceeding
to the thing proposed, namely,
the laws which govern the motion of the
planets, or <span class='fss'>ATTRACTION OF GRAVITATION</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> By attraction I think you mean
that property in bodies whereby they have
a tendency to approach each other. I
remember you told me that the magnet I
had the other day attracted the needle.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Yes. And you may recollect
that when I took a feather suspended by
a thread, and put it near the conductor of
the electrical machine, it was strongly attracted
by it, and adhered to it as long as
the machine was kept in motion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I remember it well. But what
am I to understand by attraction of gravitation?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The sun, being the largest
body, <i>attracts</i> the earth and all the other
planets, they <i>gravitate</i> or have a tendency
to approach the sun; the earth being
larger than the moon <i>attracts</i> her, and she
<i>gravitates</i> towards the earth; the planets
are attracted by and gravitate towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>each other; a stone when thrown from
the earth, by its attraction and the gravitating
power or weight of the stone, is
brought to the earth again; the waters in
the ocean gravitate towards the center of
the earth; and it is by this power we
stand on all parts of the earth with our
feet pointing to the center.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This information affords me
great pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Having mentioned attraction
of magnetism, electricity, and gravitation,
it may not be amiss to inform you of another
kind, called <i>attraction of cohesion</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Any thing which tends to my
improvement, I shall be obliged to you to
communicate.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> By attraction of cohesion is
meant that property in bodies which connects
or firmly unites the different particles
of matter of which the body is
composed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Pray, Sir, inform me what you
mean by the <i>laws</i> of attraction?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You are to understand, 1st.
That <i>attraction decreases as the squares of
the distances between the centers of the attracting
bodies increase</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I must beg you, Sir, to explain
to me the meaning of the squares of the
distances.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Any number multiplied into
itself is a square number, thus 1 is the
square of 1; 4 is the square of 2; 9 is the
square of 3, and so on, because 1 multiplied
into itself is 1; 2 by 2 is 4; 3 by 3
is 9, &amp;c. Now suppose, that when the
planet is at B (Plate II. fig. 4.) it is twice
as far from the sun as it is at A: how
much more will it be attracted by the
sun at A than at B?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> You say, Sir, that the distance
is twice as great at B as at A?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I do.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Then as the square of the distance
2 is 4, the decrease of attraction at
B, the planet at A will be attracted with
four times the force it would be at B.—Am
I right, Sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Perfectly so. And if the
distance at B were three times as great as
at A, it would be attracted with a force
nine times as great.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I perceive it must be so.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I shall now give you the 2d
law, namely, That <i>bodies attract one another
with forces proportionable to the quantities of
matter they contain</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Do all bodies of the same magnitude
contain equal quantities of matter?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> No, certainly: For a ball of
cork may be as large as one of lead, and
yet not contain the same quantity of matter,
because it is more porous, and not so
compact or dense a body as the lead;
neither will a ball of lead of the same magnitude
as one of gold contain an equal
quantity of matter.—So the sun, though
a million of times as big as the earth, contains
a quantity of matter only 200,000
as great, therefore attracts the earth with
a force 200,000 as great as the earth attracts
him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I think this is clear.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> We will now suppose that
in the river are two boats of equal bulk,
at the distance of twenty yards from
each other, and that a man in one boat
pulls a rope which is fastened to the
other, what effect will be produced, or
where do you think the boats will meet?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Had you not told me that bodies
attract one another with forces which
are proportioned to the quantities of matter
they contain, I should say the boat to
which the rope is fastened would come
to that in which the man stands: but as I
imagine you mean to apply this to attraction,
by the above rule, they will
meet at a point which is half way between
them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If one boat were three times
the bulk of the other, how then?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> The lightest would move three
times as far as the heaviest, or 15 yards
whilst the heaviest moved only 5.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Upon my word you reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>philosophically. In both cases you are
perfectly right.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> As the sun is so immense a
body that his quantity of matter is so
much greater than the planets, I am at a
loss to know why they are not by the
power of attraction drawn to him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And so they would if the attractive
power were not counteracted by
another of equal force.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Did you not say, Sir, that the
planets are kept in their orbits by attraction?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I did. But you find that by
attraction <i>only</i> the sun would draw all the
planets to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That is evident. But I wish
to know what this counteracting power
you speak of is?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I will tell you presently.—You
must remember that <i>simple</i> motion
is naturally rectilineal, that is, all bodies,
if there were nothing to prevent them,
would move in strait lines.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Then as the planetary motion
is circular, it cannot be simple?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> No. It is a <i>compound</i> of the
two forces I have been mentioning: the
one is called the attractive or centripetal
force; the other, the projectile or centrifugal
force.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> The former I clearly comprehend,
but not the latter. I can conceive,
that if two bodies approach each other
by attraction they must move in a right
line.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If you shoot a marble on a
smooth piece of ice, in what direction will
it run?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Strait forward.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> This is a projectile force.—Could
you, do you think, shoot it in any
other direction?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> No, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Then is not this motion also
rectilineal?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> When you strike a ball with
your cricket-bat, or throw a stone with
your hand, is it not projected or thrown
forward by the force of the bat or
hand?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And does it not move in a
strait line?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> At first it appears to do so;
but afterwards it inclines towards and falls
to the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Cannot you account for this?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I suppose it must be drawn to
the earth by attraction.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You are right. The attraction
of the earth, and the resistance of the
atmosphere or air through which it moves,
retards its progress, or it would continue
moving in a strait line, with a velocity
equal to that which was at first impressed
upon it. In like manner the beneficent
Creator of the Universe impressed
a force on all the planets which should
be equal to that of the attractive power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>of the sun, that one might not overcome
the other.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This wants explaining.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I would willingly gratify you,
but as I have much more to say on the
subject, I fear it will be too great a burthen
on your memory; it will therefore be
better to postpone it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> As you please, Sir.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c009'>Having at our last meeting explained
to you the nature of the attractive
and projectile forces, I shall proceed to
shew you that it is by the joint action or
combination of these two forces that the
planets are retained in their orbits.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I am all anxiety, as I wish to
be informed how, or in what manner
they can act against each other, to produce
that effect.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Answer me a few questions,
and you will soon know.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> As many as you please, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If you whirl a stone in a sling,
what will be its motion?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Circular.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Is you let it suddenly slip out
of the sling, will it continue its circular
motion?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> No, Sir, but fly off in a strait
line.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> This line you must remember
is what mathematicians call the tangent
of a circle, as A <i>a</i>, B <i>b</i>, &amp;c.
(Plate II. fig. 5.) for all bodies moving in
a circle have a natural tendency to fly off
in that direction. Thus a body at A
will tend towards <i>a</i>; at B towards <i>b</i>,
and so on; but the central force acting
against it preserves its circular motion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> By the central force here you
mean the action of the hand, do you
not?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Yes. For, as soon as the
stone is released and that power is lost,
it assumes its natural, that is, its rectilineal
motion.—Again. If you are left at
liberty, cannot you run strait forward?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Now, suppose one of your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>companions were to fasten a rope round
your body, and at the extent of it were to
stand still and hold it tight, with a force
equal to that with which you run, could
you, do you think, move in a strait line,
that is, in a tangent of a circle?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> No, Sir. I must run in a circle.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor</span>. Why?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Because, whilst the rope is extended
I am prevented running in any
other direction.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Just so it is with the planets:
the attractive or centripetal force of the
sun being equal to that of the projectile
or centrifugal force of the planets,
they are by attraction prevented moving
on in a strait line, and, as it were, drawn
towards the sun; and by the projectile
force from being overcome by attraction.
They must therefore revolve in circular
orbits.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What I have so long wished
is now accomplished. I understand it
perfectly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> What I have now explained
relates not only to the primary planets
which have the sun for their center of
motion; but, you must remember that
the secondary planets are governed by
the same laws, in revolving about their
respective primaries; for, as by the attractive
power of the sun combined with
the projectile force of the primary planets
they are retained in their orbits; so
also the action of the primaries upon
their respective secondaries together with
their projectile force, will preserve them
in their orbits.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Pray, Sir, what have you else
to observe?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Have I not told you that the
orbits of the planets are not true circles,
but a little elliptical?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Yes, Sir; and I shall be glad
to know the reason of it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If the attractive power of the
sun were uniformly the same in every
part of their orbits they would be true
circles, and the planets would pass over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span><i>equal</i> portions of their orbits in <i>equal</i>
times; that is, they would move from
B to C, (Plate II. fig. 5.) in the same
time as from A to B, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That is clear, but as their orbits
are elliptical, when the planets are
farthest from the sun, the velocity with
which they move must be lessened as the
attraction is decreased.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And they must consequently
pass over <i>unequal</i> parts of their orbits in
<i>equal</i> portions of time. And, as <i>a double
velocity will balance a quadruple or fourfold
power of gravity or attraction</i>, it follows,
that as the centripetal force is four times
as great at A as at B (Plate II. fig. 4.)
the centrifugal force will be twice as
great, and would carry a planet from
A to <i>a</i> in the same time it would from
B to <i>b</i>, and in its orbit from A to <i>c</i> as
soon as from B to <i>d</i>, and thereby describe
the area, or space contained between
the letters A S <i>c</i>, in the same time
as the area or space B S <i>d</i>. For according
to the laws of the planetary motions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>in their periodical revolutions, <i>they always
describe equal areas in equal times</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> The orbits of the comets being
very elliptical, the irregularity of
their motions must be exceedingly great.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Great, indeed!—One of them
passed so near the sun as to acquire a
heat which Sir Isaac Newton computed
to be two thousand times hotter than red
hot iron.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Astonishing! If they pass so
near the sun, the centripetal force must
act powerfully on the body of the comet.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And that force, you know,
must be equalled by the projectile force;
so you find they move when near the sun
with amazing celerity.—But when arrived
at their aphelion, where the influence
of the sun is weak, what a transition!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Wonderful, indeed!—Their
motion is excessively slow, and the sun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>must appear little more than a fixed
star. Surely they cannot be inhabited,
can they?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> We cannot speak positively;
but, as they differ so much from the planets,
which we have reason to suppose
are so, it is imagined they are designed
for some purpose unknown to us.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> When is the earth in its perihelion?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> In December; and our summer
half year is longer than the winter
half, by about eight days.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I suppose this is occasioned by
the inequality of the earth’s annual motion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is; and this inequality is
the cause of the difference of time between
the sun and a well regulated clock;
the latter keeps equal time, whilst the
former is constantly varying.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I have often seen in the almanack
clock fast, clock slow, but did not
know the meaning of it: I imagine it is
that the clock should be so much faster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>or slower than the time by the sun as is
there mentioned.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is: but there are tables calculated
to shew the difference of time
for every day in the year; so that if you
know the exact times of the day by the
sun, and have one of these tables, you will
see what the time should be by the clock,
to a second, which is not shewn in a
common almanack.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> In speaking of the annual or
yearly motion of the earth, you have no
where mentioned the cause of the seasons;
will it be agreeable to do it now, Sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The vicissitudes of the seasons,
the cause of day and night, &amp;c. shall be
the subject of future lessons: we shall find
sufficient to employ us at present.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I think you told me just now
that the earth is nearest the sun in December;
that is our winter; this seems a
little mysterious.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It may appear so to you now,
by-and-by you will be of a different opinion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>I shall explain this matter to you
with that of the seasons, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I fear I have interrupted you.—As
you said you had sufficient employment
for us, I shall be glad to know what it
is.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Hitherto I have spoken of
the sun’s being fixed, and that the planets
revolve about him as a center. Instead
of which the sun and planets move round
one common center, called the center of
gravity.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What is this center of gravity?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Have you never seen a person
raise a heavy weight by means of a
long pole or leaver, which it was not in
his power to lift without it?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Yes, Sir, and it excited my
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Now, suppose the weight to
see raised to be 10 Cwt. and the prop on
which the leaver rested 1 foot from the
body to be raised; and the person at the
other end of the leaver 10 feet from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>the prop; with what weight must he press
to raise the 10 Cwt.?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I think that very easy; for, as
he is ten times as far from the prop as
the weight is, a pressure of 1 Cwt. which
is one-tenth of the weight to be raised
will do it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> To be sure; and yet you say
you were astonished when you saw it!
Every thing we do not understand at first
appears difficult.—To apply this to our
present purpose. You see that a weight
of 1 Cwt. at 10 feet from a prop, will balance
another of 10 Cwt. at one foot from it.
Now, instead of a prop let the two weights
be nicely poised on a center, round which
they may freely turn; the heaviest would
move in a circle, whose radius, or distance
from the center would be one foot,
whilst the lightest would move in one
10 feet from the center in the same time.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Is the center round which they
move the center of gravity?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is; and round an imaginary
point as a center the sun and planets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>move, always preserving an equilibrium.
If the earth were the only attendant on
the sun, as his quantity of matter is
200,000 times as great as that of the
earth, he would revolve in a circle a
200,000th part of the earth’s distance from
him, in the same time as the earth is making
one revolution in its orbit, or in one
year; but, as the planets in their orbits
must vary in their positions, the center
of gravity cannot be always at the same
distance from the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> If it were, the balance could
not be preserved.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Clearly so. But you must
know that the quantity of matter in the
sun so far exceeds that of all the planets together,
that even if they were all in a
line on one side of him he would never
be more than his own diameter distant
from his center of gravity; therefore,
astronomers consider the sun as the center
of the system, and express themselves
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> As you told me the secondary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>planets are governed by the same laws
as the primaries, I imagine they also
with their primaries move round a center
of gravity.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> They do so.—The earth and
moon, Jupiter with his satellites, Saturn
and his attendants, revolve about their
respective centers; these, with the sun
and the rest of the planetary system,
make their circuits round their center;
every system in the universe is supposed
to revolve in like manner; and all these
together to move round one <i>common center</i>.—How
are we lost in contemplating
the omniscience of the Deity! How difficult
to conceive so many millions of
bodies of dead matter constantly in motion,
so nicely balanced and governed by
such unerring laws!—Well may we say
with the Psalmist, “Lord! how manifold
are thy works, in wisdom hast thou made
them all.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c009'>I shall now, agreeably to my promise,
explain to you the cause of day and
night, and then proceed with the vicissitudes
of the seasons.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That is what I much wish to
know; and had you not told me that the
earth moved round the sun every year, I
should have found no difficulty in accounting
for the succession of day and night,
since the sun appears to rise and set every
day.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> That is true; but I think I
must have convinced you that so immense
a body as the sun cannot revolve about
the earth; as well may you suppose that
in roasting a bird it is necessary that the
fire should move round it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That I think would be very
absurd, as it is much easier for the bird on
the spit to turn to the fire, than for the
fire to go round the bird.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You are certainly right, and
if the earth revolve on its axis every
twenty-four hours, will not the different
parts of it be alternately turned to the sun,
as the bird on the spit is to the fire?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I do not clearly comprehend
what you mean by the axis of the earth;
for, as it moves in open space and has no
support, it can have nothing to resemble
the spit on which it turns.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Certainly not. By the earth’s
axis is meant an imaginary line passing
through its center, on which it is supposed
to turn; as your ball if rolled on the
ground would revolve on an axis whilst it
was moving forward.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I can now answer your question
in the affirmative: and, as our year consists
of 365 days, I imagine the earth must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>make as many revolutions on its axis
whilst it is going once round the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Undoubtedly: and as only
one half of a spherical body can at any
time be enlightened by a luminous body,
that part of the earth only which is turned
to the sun, can receive the benefit of his
enlivening rays, when it will be day;
whilst the opposite part will be involved in
darkness, and it will be night.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I perceive it must be so. But,
if the earth move in the manner you describe,
I cannot conceive how it is that
we are not sensible of its motion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If the motion of the earth
were irregular it would be perceptible;
but as it meets with no obstruction the
motion must be so uniform as not to be
perceived.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Had I recollected this, I need
not have given you this trouble.—But I
am continually meeting with fresh difficulties.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You have only to mention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>what they are, and I shall take a pleasure
in removing them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I thank you, Sir; and shall be
obliged to you to inform me, how the
motion of the earth can cause the sun to
appear to move?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> When in a carriage which
went smoothly on the road, or in a boat
whose motion was scarcely perceptible on
the water, did you never fix your attention
on the objects you passed?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Yes, often, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And had you not known that
you really moved, and that the trees, &amp;c.
were immoveable in the ground, what then
would have been your opinion?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That the trees, &amp;c. moved in
a direction contrary to that in which I
was moving.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Is not this sufficient to convince
you that the apparent motion of
the sun may be occasioned by the revolution
of the earth on its axis?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is:—But if so large a body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>as the earth make a revolution on its axis
in 24 hours, it must move with great velocity.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It does so; and the inhabitants
of London by this motion are carried
at the rate of 560 miles an hour<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What an astonishing rapidity!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Now, the sun with the rest of
the heavenly bodies must move round the
earth, or the earth must revolve on its
axis in 24 hours, to cause that appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That is plain.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Well then, great as you may
suppose the velocity of the earth on its axis
to be, if the sun move round the earth his
hourly motion will be nearly 25 millions
of miles; and beyond conception would
be that of the fixed stars. Which now
do you think is most probable, that the sun
and stars should move round the earth, or
that they, by the simple motion of the
earth, should appear to be in motion?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> The latter, to be sure, Sir.—I
have one difficulty remaining, which is
this; if a lark rise from a field near
London and remain in the air a quarter of
an hour, if the earth move at the rate of
560 miles an hour, it will go 140 miles
whilst the lark is suspended, and yet it
continues over the field,—how can this
be?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> This objection to the motion
of the earth has been made by those who
were older and who thought themselves
wiser too than yourself. They either did
not know or did not consider, that the atmosphere
which surrounds the earth is a
part of itself, and gravitates towards it,
and therefore partakes of the earth’s motion
and carries the lark along with it.
Besides, as the Sun, Venus,
Mars, and Jupiter are known to revolve
on their axes, we have reason to suppose
that the other planets, together with the
earth, must have the same motion<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> How is it known that they do
revolve on their axes; and in what time
do they perform their revolutions?</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> By the assistance of telescopes
dark spots have been seen on the disc of
the sun, by the motion of which it is
found that he revolves on his axis in 25-1/4
days; Venus performs her diurnal revolution
in about

  </span>
as to the rest, no spot or any fixed
point has been discovered to ascertain the
length of their day; Mercury being too
near the sun, and Saturn and the Georgium
Sidus too remote for our observations.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I can no longer doubt of the
earth’s motion: and, if it will not be improper,
a description of the atmosphere will
give me pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> That I can have no objection
to. The atmosphere is a thin, invisible
fluid, most dense or heavy near the earth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>but grows gradually rarer or lighter the
higher we ascend, so much so, that at the
tops of some high mountains it is difficult
to breathe. It serves not only to suspend
the clouds, furnish us with wind and rain,
and answer the common purposes of
breathing, but is also the cause of the
morning and evening twilight, and of all
the glory and brightness of the firmament.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> How, pray?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If there were no atmosphere,
the sun would yield no light but when
our eyes were directed towards him; and
the heavens would appear dark and as full
of stars as on a dark winter’s night; but
the atmosphere being strongly illuminated
by the sun, reflects the light back upon us,
and makes the whole heavens to shine so
strongly, that the faint light of the stars
is obscured, and they are rendered invisible.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I find then the atmosphere is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>of more use than I imagined. But how
is it the cause of the twilight?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The atmosphere is about 45
miles above the surface of the earth, therefore
the sun’s rays falling upon the higher
parts of it before rising, by reflection
causes a faint light, which increases till he
appears above the horizon; and in the
evening it decreases after he sets, till he
is 18 degrees below the horizon, where the
morning twilight begins, and the evening
twilight ends.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> By the horizon, I think you
mean that distant boundary of our sight
where the heavens and the earth seem
to join all around us, as it appears from an
eminence.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The very same. ’Tis that
imaginary circle which intercepts from
our view the sun, moon, and stars each
night; and when, by the rotation of the
earth, they appear to descend below it,
we say they are set; as on the contrary,
each morning, when they appear above it,
we say they rise.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> A very pleasing description,
indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You will remember that this
is called the <i>rational horizon</i>; but that
which respects land and water is called
the <i>sensible horizon</i>. The former divides
the heavens into two equal parts, and is 90
degrees distant from a point directly over
our heads, called the <i>zenith</i>, and the opposite
point of the heavens directly under
our feet, called the <i>nadir</i>.—But I must
resume the subject of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Had I not thought you had
finished your description of the atmosphere,
I should not have presumed to interrupt
you.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> What I have told you respecting
the horizon is necessary for you
to be acquainted with; therefore, the
suspension is immaterial.—You must, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>make no doubt, have observed the sun
and moon at rising and setting to appear
larger than when higher above the horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I have, frequently, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And cannot you tell the reason
of it?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> No, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The reason is this: In viewing
them, when near the horizon, you see
them through a thicker medium than
when they are higher, that is, you see
them through a greater quantity of the
atmosphere; and you not only see them
larger, but really above the horizon whilst
they are actually below it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> How do you account for this,
Sir?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Light, like material bodies,
if it meet with no obstruction, will move
in right lines; now, the rays of the sun
in coming to the earth must pass through
a great quantity of the atmosphere, which
being a fluid, refracts or bends the rays of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>light, by which refraction it is that we are
favoured with the sight of the sun 3-1/4 minutes
every morning before he rises above
the horizon, and every evening after he
sinks below it, which in one year amounts
to more than 40 hours. This refraction
is greatest near the horizon, and ends in
the zenith.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Pray, Sir, can you make this
clearer by an experiment?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I have just thought of one.
Take a bason filled with water, and a
strait stick or piece of wire; put it perpendicularly
into the water, that is, that it
lean neither way, and there will be no refraction;
incline it a little towards the
edge of the bason and it will appear a
little bent at the surface of the water;
incline it still more, and the refraction will
be greater.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I have often seen this appearance
when I have put my stick into
water, but did not before know the
cause.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You may try one more experiment.
Pour the water out of the bason,
and set the bason on the floor; put a
guinea into it, and let it represent the sun.—Why
do you smile?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Because I have not the sun’s
representative to try the experiment with.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Well, well, put a shilling into
the bason and call it the moon, and it will
answer the same purpose:—Walk backward
till you just lose sight of it, then the
right line from your eye continued over
the edge of the bason must pass beyond
the money at the bottom of it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That is evident.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Keep your position, and desire
some friend to pour the water gently
into the bason so as not to remove the
money, and you will clearly distinguish
it. Now, if you call the edge of the bason
the horizon, the water the atmosphere,
and the shilling the moon, is it not clear
that you will see it above the horizon,
when it is really below it?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I think so, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Well, try the experiment,
and let me know the result when I next
see you.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c009'>I presume, Sir, you have made the experiment
I recommended to you.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I have, Sir; and am so well
convinced of what you told me, that nothing
farther need be said on the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> As that is the case, I shall
proceed.—I dare say you do not forget
what the plane of the ecliptic is.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I do not, Sir; but have a perfect
recollection of it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Now, remember, that the
axis of the earth is not upright or perpendicular
to the plane of the ecliptic, but
inclines to, or leans towards it, 23-1/2 degrees,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>and makes an angle with it of 66-1/2
degrees.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> An angle signifies a corner;
but that cannot be the meaning here.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> That is what is generally understood
by an angle: but, in geometry,
it means the meeting of any two lines
which incline to one another, in a certain
point. Now, if you conceive the axis
of the earth to be one line, and the plane
of the ecliptic the other, the point where
they meet or cross each other will form an
angle.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I think I understand it; but
how can it contain 23-1/2 or 66-1/2 degrees?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You know what a degree is.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> If I remember right it is the
360th part of a circle.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is so: and the measure of
an angle is an arc or part of the circumference
of a circle, whose angular point is
the center: and so many 360th parts as
any arc contains, so many degrees the
measure of the angle is said to be; thus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Z C P (Plate III. fig. 1.) makes an angle
of 23-1/2 degrees, because the arc Z P contains
23-1/2 360th parts of the whole circle.
Then if A B represent the plane of the
ecliptic, and N C S the axis of the earth,
as D N contains the same number of degrees
as Z P, will not its inclination from
a perpendicular be 23-1/2 degrees?</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/plate-3.jpg' alt='Plate III' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Nothing can be plainer.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> For the same reason, as P B
contains 66-1/2 parts of the whole circle, the
axis of the earth makes an angle of 66-1/2
degrees with the plane of the ecliptic.
And, if you add 23-1/2 to 66-1/2 the sum will
be 90, which is the measure Z B, or the
fourth part of the circle, and makes what
is called a right angle, at the point or
center C.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is very clear:—but what
do the other letters refer to?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The extremities of the earth’s
axis are called the poles, N the north,
and S the south pole, and P the north-pole
star, to which, and to the opposite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>part of the heavens, the axis always
points. These extremities in the heavens
appear motionless, whilst all other
parts seem in a continual state of revolution:
the circle of motion appears to increase
with the distance from the apparently
motionless points to that circle in
the heavens which is at an equal distance
between them, called the equinoctial, represented
by the letters Æ Q; and is the
same I promised some time ago to explain
to you.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I recollect it: and as the line
A B represents the plane of the ecliptic,
I suppose the line Æ Q is the plane of the
equinoctial, which I see crosses it as you
then told me.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You are right: and it makes
an angle with it of 23-1/2 degrees. It is
called the equinoctial, because when the
sun appears there, that is, in Aries or Libra,
the days and nights are equal in all
parts of the world, which I shall shew you
in due time; and shall now explain to you
what I have just mentioned, that the axis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>of the earth always points to the same parts
of the heavens. I am apprehensive you
will think it strange that this should be
the case, and the axis keep parallel to itself.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What am I to understand by
the axis being parallel to itself?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Two lines are said to be
parallel when they do not incline to but
keep at equal distances from each other;
so that if they were infinitely continued,
they would never meet. Now, if you can
conceive a line drawn parallel to the
earth’s axis in any part of its orbit, it will
be parallel to it in every other part of it.
A little drawing I have by me, (Plate
III. fig 2.) where the earth is represented
in four different parts of its orbit, I think
will make this plain to you.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I comprehend your meaning
clearly. But, as the orbit of the earth is
190 millions of miles in diameter, I have
not the least conception how it can incline
to the same points. Had you not told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>me to the contrary, I should have thought
it must move round them in every revolution
of the earth about the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> That such a motion would be
perceptible is evident, if the fixed stars
were near the earth; but, compared
with their distance, 190 millions of miles
is but a mere point: therefore, the axis
always inclines to the same points of the
heavens.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This is a greater proof of the
inconceivable distance of the stars than
what you mentioned before, and I
thought that very astonishing:</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is very true. And the
more we search, the more we have cause
to admire the works of the Almighty.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Pray, Sir, what is the next
thing you propose?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> To make you acquainted
with the other circles you see in the figure
(Plate III. fig. 1.) as it is very necessary
you should know them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Will you be kind enough to
tell me their names, Sir, and I will endeavour
to remember them?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> That line which divides the
globe into two equal parts, called the
northern and southern hemispheres, which
answers to the equinoctial in the heavens,
and is equally distant from the two poles,
is called the <i>equator</i>; the other which
crosses it, as I before told you, is the
<i>ecliptic</i>; the smaller circle, north of the
equator, is the <i>tropic of Cancer</i>; that
south of it, the <i>tropic of Capricorn</i>; the
circles next the poles are called the <i>polar
circles</i>; or that next the north pole, the
<i>arctic circle</i>, and that next the south
pole, the <i>antarctic circle</i>; each of which
is 23-1/2 degrees distant from its respective
pole, as are the tropics from the equator.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> You have not mentioned the
lines which cross the other circles, and
terminate in the poles; what are they
called?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> They are called <i>meridians</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>because when any of them, as the earth
revolves on its axis, is opposite to the
sun, it is mid-day or noon along that
line. Twenty-four of these lines are
usually drawn on the globe to correspond
with the twenty-four hours of the day; but
you are not to suppose there are no more
than twenty-four; for every place that lies
ever so little east or west of another place
has a different meridian.—To make this
clearer to you, we will suppose the upper
12 (Plate III. fig. 1.) to be opposite the
sun, it will of course be noon along that
line; the next meridian marked 1, being
15 degrees east, will have passed the meridian
1 hour, consequently it will there
be one in the afternoon, and so on, according
to the order of the figures, till
you come to the lower 12, which being
the part of the earth turned directly from
the sun, it will be midnight on that meridian;
on the next meridian, as you
proceed round, it will be one in the
morning, the next two, and so on till
you arrive at the upper twelve, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>you set off. So you see there must be a
continual succession of day and night.
This difference of time between places
lying under different meridians is what is
called longitude.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I think I have heard of a Mr.
Harrison, who made a time-keeper for
determining the longitude. Shall I trespass
at all if I beg a little farther information
on this subject?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is my wish at all times to
satisfy your curiosity, when I can do it
with propriety. I shall therefore comply
with your request.—Mr. Harrison’s time-keeper,
and those made since by other
artists, are so constructed, that the heat
and cold of different climates will not
affect them; for, all metals are more or
less expanded by heat, and contracted
by cold; for which reason it is, that a
clock or watch made in the usual way
will not keep equal time. Now, all that
is required of these time-keepers to ascertain
the longitude is this: Suppose
a captain of a vessel sailing from London
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>to the West Indies, we will say Kingston,
in Jamaica. On his passage thither he
makes an observation, and finds the sun
on the meridian, or that it is twelve
o’clock in that situation, when by his
time-keeper it is two in the afternoon in
London, whence he concludes he is 30
degrees west of London.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I must beg you to explain this
to me, as I do not understand why two
hours of time should be equal to 30 degrees
of longitude.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You must consider, that as
the earth makes a complete revolution
on its axis in 24 hours, it must pass over
360 degrees in that time: now, if you
divide 360 by 24, the quotient 15, will
be the number of degrees passed over in
one hour; 30 degrees will be equal to
two hours, &amp;c. The difference of time
between London and his situation is two
hours, consequently the difference of longitude
must be 30 degrees: and, it must
be west, because the sun had passed the
meridian of London; for, as the earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>revolves from west by south to east, one
place which lies east of another must
come first to the meridian or opposite to
the sun. Therefore, when longitude is
reckoned from London, if the place lie
east of that meridian the time will be before;
if west, after London.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I see it clearly; and as 60 minutes
make an hour, if I divide it by 15,
the quotient 4 will be the minutes answering
to one degree.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You are right: and for the
same reason, 4 seconds of time are equal
to one minute of longitude, which you
know is the 60th part of a degree.—Our
captain when arrived at Kingston, finds
the difference of time between it and
London 5 ho. 6 min. 32 sec. Can you
tell me the longitude of Kingston?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> If I bring the hours and minutes
to minutes, and divide by 4, the quotient
I think will be degrees, will it not?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It will: and the seconds of
time divided by 4, will be minutes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>of longitude. Now try if you can do
it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Five hours 6 minutes, multiplied
by 60 will be 306 minutes, this
divided by 4, will give 76 degrees and
2 over, which 2 is half a degree, or 30
minutes: and 32 seconds of time divided
by 4, will be 8 minutes of longitude,
the sum of which is 76 degrees 38 minutes
for the longitude of Kingston.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Very well.—I have just now
thought of another method of reducing
time to longitude, and longitude to time,
which you may probably find easier.
However, when you are in possession of
both, you may use which you please.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That which is easiest must, I
think, be best.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I will give it you, and let

<p class='c018'>Divide the degrees and minutes of longitude
by 5 and 3 and the quotient will

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I give this the preference.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> As longitude is seldom mentioned
without being accompanied with
latitude, that you may not be ignorant
of its meaning when you meet with it,
I shall just tell you that it is the distance
of any place from the equator, reckoned
in degrees and minutes on the meridian,
and is either north or south as the place
lies north or south of the equator. The
latitude of any place is equal to the elevation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>of the pole above the horizon.
The latitude of the heavenly bodies is
reckoned from the ecliptic, and terminates
in the arctic and antarctic circles: and
their longitude begins at the point Aries.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What is the measure of a degree?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> A degree of latitude is 60
geographical, or 69-1/2 English miles: and a
degree of longitude on the equator is
equal to it, because the equator as well
as the meridians divides the globe into
two equal parts. But a degree of longitude
decreases as you approach the
poles: for at the poles the meridians
meet in a point, consequently a degree
there can have no dimension. To-morrow
I will shew you the cause of the seasons.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c009'>I think, Sir, when you left me last
night you told me our next business
would be to explain the nature of the
seasons?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I did so, and am persuaded
you will find no great difficulty in comprehending
it.—Cast your eye on the
little drawing I gave you, (Plate III.
fig. 2.) where the earth is represented as
situated at the four quarters of the year,
namely, Spring, Summer, Autumn, and
Winter.—But before we proceed to an
explanation it will be necessary to remark,
that, in the little scheme the eye is supposed
to be elevated above the plane of
the earth’s orbit, and that we see it very
obliquely. The orbit by this means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>appears very elliptical; and, the enlightened
hemisphere, or that half of the
earth which is turned to the sun in the
spring, and the darkened hemisphere, or
that turned from him in the autumn, are
there represented.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This I understand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Well then, we will begin with
the spring.—In this situation of the earth
the equator is exactly opposed to the sun:
and, as he always enlightens a hemisphere,
or half of its surface, his rays will
reach to both the poles: whence, from
the diurnal revolution of the earth, the
day and night are equal all over the
globe.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This I remember you told me
happened when the sun was in Aries and
Libra. The sun is now entering Aries:
and, as we are in the rays of the sun one
half of the diurnal revolution, and in the
shadow of the earth, or dark, the other
half, the day and night must be equal.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Certainly. And as the sun
enters Aries in the equinoctial, it is then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>called the <i>Vernal</i>, that is, <i>Spring Equinox</i>.
When the sun enters the opposite sign
Libra, the same effects are produced, and
it is then called the <i>Autumnal Equinox</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> You have passed on from Spring
to Autumn.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I have so.—We will now return,
and trace the earth in its orbit from
spring to summer.—You have already seen
that the north and south poles are both
enlightened, and that the day and night
are equal at the equinoxes. If the axis
of the earth were perpendicular to the
plane of the earth’s orbit, this would constantly
be the case, and we should have
no diversity of seasons: for, the sun being
over the equator, the poles must be
perpetually enlightened, and of course we
should have equal day and night at all
times of the year.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That is plain. I suppose then
that it is to the inclination of the earth’s
axis we are indebted for the increase and
decrease of days.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is occasioned by the inclination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>of the earth’s axis and its preserving
its parallelism, which I explained to you
last evening.—As the sun is now in the
first point of Aries, the earth you know
must be in the beginning of Libra, it
being the opposite sign.—Now fix your
attention on the scheme, and imagine the
earth to be advancing in its orbit through
Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius: and at
the first degree of Capricorn give me
your opinion of the earth’s position.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> The north pole is turned to
the sun, the south pole from him, and
the tropic of Cancer is opposite to him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> How many degrees are the
tropics from the equator, or, in other
words, what is the inclination of the earth’s
axis?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Twenty-three degrees and a
half.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And so far are the rays of
the sun cast beyond the north pole, and
fall short of the south pole: so that the
whole of the arctic circle is enlightened,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and the antarctic circle involved in darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What conclusion am I to draw
from this?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> That in the northern half of
the globe it is the longest day, or summer,
and in the southern half the shortest,
or winter, whilst under the equator
the days and nights are equal.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I used to think that when it was
winter or summer here it was so in every
part of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You now find your mistake.
For as the earth is making its progress
from Libra, the north pole is approaching
the sun, and the south pole receding from
him: consequently the length of the day
is increasing in the northern hemisphere
and decreasing in the southern.—The
sun has now been three months above
the horizon of the north pole, and the
same time below that of the south pole,
and in three months more, when the
earth arrives at Aries, the scene will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>reversed: the sun will be over the equator,
both poles will be again enlightened,
and the day and night will be equal in
every part of the globe. The sun will
now be rising to the south and setting to
the north pole. This is our Autumn.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> And as the earth is advancing
towards winter, the south pole will
be turning to the sun, and the north pole
from him, whence I conclude that when
the earth is in Cancer it must be summer,
south of the equator, when it is our winter.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Most assuredly. For you
see that the sun is over the tropic of Capricorn,
which you know is as much
south of the equator as the tropic of
Cancer is north of it, where the sun was
in our summer. The antarctic circle is
now enlightened, and the arctic obscured
in shade; but, under the equator there
is neither increase nor decrease, the days
and nights being each twelve hours.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is now our winter, the sun
has been three months above the horizon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of the south pole, and will continue
so till the vernal equinox, when he will
again rise to the north pole, and so on in
regular succession.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It must be plain then to you
that there can be but one day and one
night at each of the poles, reckoning the
time the sun is above or below their respective
horizons; under the arctic and
antarctic circles, the longest day is twenty-four
hours, and in the shortest the
sun is just visible in the horizon at noon.
The longest day decreases in length the
nearer we approach the equator, where
I before observed there is no variation,
because the circle bounding light and
darkness, in every position of the earth,
divides the equator into two equal parts;
and, it must be observed, that the longest
day and longest night are equal to each
other in every part of the globe.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> If the longest day under the
arctic circle be just twenty-four hours,
the sun must rise in the north.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> He does so, makes a complete circle
and sets in the <a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a>north again.
From the arctic circle to the equator,
he rises north of the east and sets north
of the west: at the equator he rises due
east and sets due west, thence southward
to the antarctic circle, he rises south of
the east, and sets south of the west: and
under the antarctic circle, as I observed
just now, he is visible in the horizon in
the south at noon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> We usually say, the sun rises
in the east and sets in the west.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> At the equinoxes it must be so
in all parts of the globe, the poles excepted:
in every other situation, except under
the equator, there is a continual
change. What I have now told you,
respecting the northern hemisphere, will
be reversed at our shortest day: that is,
in the northern hemisphere the sun will
rise south of the east and set south of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the west; and, in the southern hemisphere
the contrary, the sun will be in the horizon,
at noon, under the arctic circle, and
the day will be twenty-four hours under
the antarctic circle.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Pray Sir, are the regions within
the polar circles inhabited? If they
are, their situation, in winter, must, I
think, be dreadful.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is foreign to my present
purpose to speak of the inhabitants of
the earth, as that more properly belongs
to Geography. Thus much however I
shall tell you, that, although it must be
very cold and dreary, they are not so long
deprived of light as you may imagine;
for, even under the poles, when the sun
is hidden from them, they are but a short
time in total darkness, for, you must recollect,
that the twilight continues till the
sun is eighteen degrees below the horizon;
and the sun’s greatest depression,
you know, can be but twenty three degrees
and a half, equal to the inclination
of the earth’s axis. Besides this, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>moon is above the horizon of the poles a
fortnight together; being half her period
north, and the other half south, of the
equator; and, as the moon at full is in
the sign opposite to the sun, the tropical
full moons must be twenty-four hours
above the horizon at the polar circles.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This description is very pleasing,
as I had no idea of their being favoured
with so much light in the absence
of the sun: and, I find, as the sun is longer
above the horizon in summer than in
winter, the moon, on the contrary, continues
longer with us in winter, when we
most need her assistance, than she does in
summer.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> As you seem to understand
what I have been explaining, I shall shew
you, that the reason why it is hottest when
we are farthest from the sun is, that in
winter when we are nearest to him the
days are shorter, his rays sail very obliquely
on us, and are more dispersed than they
are in summer, when he not only remains
longer above the horizon, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>being higher, his rays fall more direct on
us, by which means the earth becomes so
much heated that it has not time in the
short nights to get cold again.—When
the earth is nearest the sun it is summer
in the southern hemisphere, therefore it
is reasonable to suppose that the heat
there must far exceed ours in the same
latitude; but to counteract this their
summer is shorter by eight days than
ours: and it is well known that it is much
colder near the poles in the southern than
in the northern hemisphere: but this is
accounted for from there being more
land to retain the heat in the latter than
in the former.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> My doubts on this head being
now removed, I must beg you to give
me such other information as you may
think proper.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> As there are different degrees
of heat and cold, the earth has been divided
into five zones, namely, one torrid,
two temperate, and two frigid zones.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> How are they distinguished?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The torrid zone is all that
space surrounding the globe contained
between the tropics, having the equator
running through the middle of it. It is
so called on account of its excessive heat,
for, twice every year the sun is vertical
to the inhabitants, that is, he shines directly
on their heads, and casts no shadow,
but under their feet, at noon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> We find it sometimes extremely
hot here in our summer; surely, in the
torrid zone it must be almost insupportable?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> They are inured to it from their
infancy.—But we are departing from our
subject.—The temperate zones are comprehended
between the tropics and polar
circles, that between the tropic of Cancer
and the arctic circle is called the north
temperate zone, and that between the
tropic of Capricorn and the antarctic circle
the south temperate zone.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I suppose they are called temperate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>because the heat is not so intense as
in the torrid zone?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> True. Neither is the cold
so severe as in the frigid zones, which are
those regions comprized within the polar
circles, and are denominated north and
south, as they are contiguous to the north
or south poles.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Why are they called frigid?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> They are called frigid or
frozen zones, because near the poles there
are perpetual fields of ice, the heat of
the sun, even in summer, being insufficient
to dissolve it.—Now try if you can
tell me the breadth of each zone in degrees.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> The torrid zone being twenty-three
degrees and a half on each side the
equator must be forty-seven degrees,
which must also be the breadth of the
frigid zones, as the polar circles are distant
twenty-three degrees and a half from
the poles, which are their centers. And,
as from the equator to either pole is
ninety degrees, from the equator to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>tropics twenty-three and a half, and from
the polar circle to the pole twenty-three
and a half, if the sum of these, that is, forty-seven,
be taken from ninety, the remainder,
forty-three, will be the breadth of each of
the temperate zones.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Very well.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> From what you have told me
I have no doubt but that the earth is
globular, but I have no proof of it: I
must therefore beg your assistance.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> That it cannot be an extended
plane, as some have imagined, is very evident;
for, if it were, the angle made with
that plane and the north pole star would
be always equal, for reasons I have before
given you: neither can it be cylindrical,
that is like a garden roller, as
others have supposed.—If a person travel
northward the pole star becomes more
elevated, and if he could penetrate to the
north pole of the earth the star would be
in the zenith, or directly over his head:
on the contrary, if he travel southward,
it is more and more depressed till he arrives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>at the equator, where the star is in
the horizon; as he proceeds it disappears,
and other stars rise to his view, invisible
to us. Here then you see it must be circular
northward and southward.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I am convinced it must be
so.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And it is as certain that it
is so east and west: for, navigators have
often sailed round it steering the same
course: that is, if they sail an easterly or
westerly course at setting off, by continuing
the same course they will return to
the port whence they departed. This
you know they could not do if it were
not round, any more than an insect could,
by crossing a round table, arrive at the
place it set out from; but, by going round
the edge it would be still going forward
and come again to the point it had left.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is very evident.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Again. In every direction,
if a ship be seen at a distance, the first
things observed are the top-mast and rigging,
whilst the hull or body of the ship is
hidden behind the convexity, that is roundness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>of the water, just as you would see a
man coming over a hill, you would first
see his head, he would be rising more and
more to your view till he arrived at the
top, where he would be full in sight.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I am at a loss to account
for the convexity of the water. How
can its surface be round?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Have you never observed
the drops of water falling from the eaves
of a house?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Often, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Of what shape were they?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Globular.—But what is the
cause of their being so?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Attraction.—For as every
particle of water which composes the
drop tends to the same center, every part
of the surface must be equidistant from
the center, it must therefore be spherical.
In like manner if you separate quicksilver,
each portion will form itself into a
globe.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> All this is very clear. And,
for the same reason, the water in the ocean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>must be convex; for, I remember you
told me that it gravitated towards the
center of the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Once more.—I think you
must have seen an eclipse of the moon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I have, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Of what figure was the darkened
part?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Circular.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Take this ball, and hold it before
the candle between your finger and
thumb, so that the shadow may be thrown
on the wall, and in all positions you will
find it circular.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is so.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Apply this crown piece in the
same manner, with the flat side to the
candle.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is a circle.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Turn it a little obliquely.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is now an ellipsis.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Now turn the edge to the
candle.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> The shadow is a strait line.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You now see that no other
body than that of a globe can in all positions
cast a circular shadow.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I do, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The darkness on the disc of
the moon at the time of an eclipse is the
shadow of the earth, which in all situations
is circular; the earth, therefore,
which casts the shadow, must be a globe.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It must be so.—But——</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The earth is mountainous.—It
is so: but remember that the highest
mountain bears no greater proportion to
the bulk of the earth than the small irregularities
on the peel of an orange bears to
that fruit: that objection therefore is
soon removed. And yet it is not a true
sphere.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What then?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> A spheroid, that is, it is a
little flattened at the poles, and is in shape
not unlike an orange or a turnip. This
you will not be surprized at when I tell
you that the equatorial parts are about
four thousand miles from the center of
motion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I suppose then you infer that
as the centrifugal force is greater the farther
it is removed from the center, that
the parts near the poles have a tendency
to fly off towards the equator.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I do. And as we have finished
this part of our subject, I shall take
leave of you.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c009'>I now propose giving you a description
of the moon, and I doubt not
it will afford you some degree of pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Indeed it will, as I know little
more than that she is a secondary planet
or satellite, revolving round the earth, and
with it round the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You know her mean distance
from the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I did not recollect that: 240
thousand miles.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Right. Her diameter is
about 2161 miles, and her bulk about a
fiftieth part of the earth’s. Her axis is
almost perpendicular to the plane of the
ecliptic, consequently she can have no
diversity of seasons.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What is her period?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The time she takes to revolve
from one point of the heavens to the
same again is called her <i>siderial</i> or <i>periodical
revolution</i>, and is performed in 27
days, 7 hours, 43 minutes; but <i>synodical
revolution</i>, or the time taken up to
revolve from the sun to the same apparent
situation with respect to the sun
again, or from change to change, is 29
days, 12 hours, and 44 minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I do not clearly comprehend
it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If the earth had no annual motion,
the period of the moon would be uniformly
27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes; but
you are to consider that whilst the moon is
revolving round the earth, the earth is
advancing in its orbit, and of course she
must be so much longer in completing
her synodical revolution as the difference
of time between that and her siderial revolution.
This I will make clear to you
in a few minutes.—What is the situation
of the hour-hand and minute-hand of a
watch at twelve o’clock?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> They will be in conjunction.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And will they be in conjunction
at one?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> No, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Yet the minute-hand has
made a complete revolution: but before
they can be in conjunction again the minute-hand
must move forward till it overtakes
the hour-hand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I now understand it, and must
beg you to explain to me the different
phases of the moon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Take this ivory ball, and suspend
it by the string with your hand between
your eye and the candle. Let the
candle represent the sun, the ball the
moon, and your head the earth. In this
situation, as the candle enlightens only one
half of the ball, the part turned from you
will be enlightened, and the part turned
to you will be dark. This will be a representation
of the moon at change, and
as no part of her enlightened hemisphere
is turned to the earth, she can reflect no
light upon it, and consequently is invisible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>to us. She now rises and sets nearly with
the sun.—Turn yourself a little to the left,
and you will observe a streak of light like
what is called the new moon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I see it clearly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Move round one quarter.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> One half of the side next me is
now enlightened.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You may conceive it to be
the moon at first quarter.—Go on, and
you will see the light increase till the ball
is opposite to the candle, when the side
next you will be wholly illumined, and
will give you a just idea of the moon at
full, which now rises about the time of
sun-setting, being opposite to the sun:
and, the farther she advances in her orbit
the later she rises.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is plain it must be so. She
rises with the sun at change, being then in
conjunction: and as she revolves in her
orbit the same way as the earth does on
its axis, the earth will have farther to revolve
each day before it can see the
moon. At the full she is in opposition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>and of course rises when the sun sets: and
so continues to rise later and later, till the
change again.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You imagine that the moon
rises exactly with the sun when she is at
change; and when he sets, at full. I will
presently convince you of your mistake;
and would have you now proceed with
your ball. Place it again opposite to the
candle, and as you turn round you will
find the light gradually decrease as it before
increased, that the side that was before
enlightened is now dark, and the
dark side light. When you have gone
three quarters round, one half of the side
next you will be enlightened, and will resemble
the moon at last quarter. As
you go on the darkened part will increase,
till you arrive at the place you set off
from, where the light is quite obscured.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I have now completed the circuit,
and am much delighted with it, as by
this simple contrivance I can perceive
the various changes of the moon, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>that the western side is enlightened from
the change to the full, and the eastern side
from the full to the change.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I find then it has fully answered
the purpose intended.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Indeed it has. But if you will
give me leave I will use the ball again.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> By all means.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I perceive, as I move round,
that the same side of the ball is turned
towards me whilst every part is turned
to the candle. Is it so with the moon?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is: and as every part of the
moon is turned to the sun, she makes one
revolution on her axis whilst she makes
one in her orbit.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This is very singular. If the
same side of the moon be always turned
to the earth, the opposite side of course
can never see it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> And they must likewise be deprived
of the earth as a moon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> True. But how is it known
that the same side of the moon is always
opposed to the earth?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The moon, like our earth,
consists of mountains and valleys, which,
when seen through a good telescope, are
very beautiful. The mountainous parts
appear as lucid spots and bright streaks
of light: and as the same spots, &amp;c. are
constantly turned to the earth, she must
keep the same side to the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> It is very clear. Are there no
seas?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It was formerly imagined that
the dark parts were seas, but later observations
prove that they are hollow places
or caverns, which do not reflect the light
of the sun. Besides, if there were seas
there would consequently be exhalations,
and if exhalations, clouds and vapours, and
an atmosphere to support them. That
there are no clouds is evident, because
when our atmosphere is clear, and the
moon above our horizon in the night-time,
all her parts appear constantly with
the same clear, serene, and calm aspect.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Has the moon then no atmosphere?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If she has it is imperceptible
to us: for, when she approaches any star,
we cannot discover with our best telescopes
any change of colour or diminution
of lustre in the star till the instant it
is lost behind her: whence it is clear, that
she can have no such gross medium as our
atmosphere to surround her.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> May we not then doubt whether
she be inhabited or not, as without
air we cannot breathe?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The same Almighty Being
who created us and gave us air to breathe,
may have provided a different way for
their existence. It does not hold good
that, because we could not live there, she
is not inhabited. Fish will live a considerable
time in water under an exhausted
receiver: and, I have heard of a toad
being found in a block of marble. Your
doubt therefore, I think, ought not to be
admitted.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I am satisfied. And must now
beg to be informed how I may observe
the moon’s motion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Her real motion round the
earth, may be easily known by remarking
when she is near any particular star.
Thus, suppose you see her west, that is to
the right of it, she will be approaching,
then in conjunction with, and afterwards
pass it towards the east. Her apparent
motion is that of rising and setting, which
is occasioned by the rotation of the earth
on its axis.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I remember not long since,
when you shewed me Jupiter, that the
moon was west of him: the next evening
I saw her almost appear to touch him,
and soon after at a great distance from him
easterly. I now see that her real motion
is from west by south to east, and her
apparent motion from east by south to
west.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If you have no objection, I
will now explain the cause of eclipses.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> So far from it, that it will give
me the greatest pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Take your ivory ball, suspend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>it as before, in a right line between your
eye and the candle.—Can you see the
candle?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> No, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> For what reason.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Because the ball prevents the
light coming to me.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> This then represents an eclipse
of the sun, which can never happen but
when the moon is between the sun and
the earth, which must be at the change:
for, as light passes in a right line, the sun
is hidden to that part of the earth which
is under the moon, and therefore he must
be eclipsed. If the whole of the sun be
obscured by the body of the moon, the
eclipse is total: if only a part be darkened,
it is a partial eclipse; and so many
twelfth parts of the sun’s diameter, as the
moon covers, so many digits are said to
be eclipsed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> May not the word digit be applied
to the moon as well as the sun?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It may: for it means a twelfth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>part of the diameter of either the sun, or
the moon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> As you have now shewn me
the cause of an eclipse of the sun, I am
anxious to have that of the moon explained.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> We must again have recourse
to your little ball.—Turn yourself round
till it is opposite to the candle in a line
with your head, and you will see that no
light can be thrown on it from the candle,
because your head is between them. In
like manner the rays of the sun are prevented
falling on the moon, by the interposition
of the earth: she must therefore
be eclipsed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I see it clearly. And as an
eclipse of the sun happens when the moon
is at change, that of the moon must be
when she is at full; for, it is then only
the earth’s shadow can fall on the moon,
the earth being at no other time between
the sun and her.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The diameter of the shadow
is about three times that of the moon, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>consequently the moon must be totally
eclipsed whilst she continues in it. On
the contrary, the shadow of the moon at
an eclipse of the sun, covers so small a
part of the earth’s surface, that the sun is
totally or centrally eclipsed to but a small
part of it; and its duration is very short.
But a faint or partial shadow surrounds
this darkened shade, in which the sun is
more or less eclipsed, as the place is
nearer to or farther from its center; this
partial shadow is called the <i>penumbra</i>. I
have prepared for you a little drawing,
representing an eclipse both of the sun
and moon, which I think will enable
you better to understand what I have
been explaining. (Plate IV. Fig. 1 and
2.) In the former, <i>p. p.</i> is the penumbra.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/plate-4.jpg' alt='Plate IV' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> In what does a central differ
from a total eclipse?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> An eclipse of the sun may be
central, and not total; for, those who are
under the point of the dark shadow, will
see the edge of the sun like a fine luminous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>ring, all around the dark body of
the moon when the sun is eclipsed at the
moon’s greatest distance from the earth;
but when she is nearest the earth at an
eclipse of the sun, the eclipse is total.
When the penumbra first touches the
earth, the general eclipse begins; when it
leaves the earth, the general eclipse ends.
An eclipse of the moon always begins on
the moon’s eastern side, and goes off on
her western side; but an eclipse of the
sun begins on the sun’s western side, and
goes off on his eastern side. When the
moon is eclipsed in either of her nodes,
the eclipse is both central and total.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Pray, what is the reason we
have not an eclipse at every full and
change of the moon?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> For the same reason that
Mercury and Venus are not seen to pass
over she sun’s disc at every inferior conjunction.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Is the orbit of the moon then
inclined to the plane of the ecliptic?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is: and no eclipse of the
sun can happen but when the moon is
within 17 degrees of either of her nodes:
neither can there be one of the moon,
unless she be within 12 degrees. At all
other new moons she passeth either above
or below the sun, as seen from the earth:
and at all other full moons above or below
the earth’s shadow, according as she
is north or south of the ecliptic. You
now see that the moon must sometimes
rise before and sometimes after the sun
at change, and before or after he sets at
full.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I do, Sir, and am much obliged
to you for this pleasing account of the
moon, and of eclipses: and if you have
any thing farther to observe, it will afford
me additional pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You may, at some time or
other, have an opportunity of seeing a
total eclipse of the moon; it will therefore
be necessary to prepare you for a phænomenon
which otherwise you might be
much surprized at, and that is, that after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>the moon is immersed in the earth’s shadow,
she is still visible.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This is a phænomenon that I
am not able to account for; for, the
moon being an opaque body, she cannot
shine by her own light<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a>, and the rays of
the sun are prevented falling on her by
the interposition of the earth, she cannot
therefore shine by reflection.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is by reflection that we see
her; for the rays of the sun which fall
upon our atmosphere are refracted or
bent into the earth’s shadow, and so falling
upon the moon are reflected back to us.
If we had no atmosphere, she would be
totally dark, and of course invisible
to us.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What is her appearance?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> It is that of a dusky colour,
somewhat like tarnished copper.—I have
one thing more to remark before we quit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>this subject, which is, that the moon’s
nodes have a retrograde or backward motion,
in a direction contrary to the earth’s
annual motion, and go through all the
signs and degrees of the ecliptic in little
less than nineteen years, when there will
be a regular period of eclipses, or return
of the same eclipses for many ages.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Pray, Sir, what do you propose
for our next subject?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The ebbing and flowing of
the sea, or cause of the tides.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c009'>In order to explain the cause of the
tides, I have since I saw you last prepared
a little drawing for you, (Plate
IV. fig. 3.) where S represents the sun,
M the moon at change, E the center of
the earth, and A B C D its surface, covered
with water. It is obvious, from
the principles of gravitation, that if the
earth were at rest the water in the ocean
would be truly spherical, if its figure were
not altered by the action of some other
power. But, daily experience proves that
it is continually agitated.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What is the cause of this agitation?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The attraction of the sun
and moon, particularly the latter: for, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>she is so much nearer the earth than the
sun, she attracts with a much greater
force than he does, and consequently
raises the water much higher, which, being
a fluid, loses as it were its gravitating
power, and yields to their superior force.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> What proportion does the attractive
power of the sun bear to that of
the moon?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> As three to ten. So when
the moon is at change, the sun and moon
being in conjunction, or on the same
side of the earth, the action of both bodies
is on the surface of the water, the moon
raising it ten parts,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a> and the sun three,
the sum of which is thirteen parts, represented
by B <i>b</i>. Now it is evident, that
if thirteen parts be added by the attractive
power of those bodies, the same
number of parts must be drawn off from
some other part, as A <i>a</i>, C <i>c</i>. It will
now be high-water under the moon at
<i>b</i>, and its opposite side <i>d</i>, and low-water
at <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> That the attraction of the sun
and moon must occasion a swelling of the
waters on the side next them, I can readily
conceive, and that this swell must
cause a falling off at the sides: but that
the tide should rise as high on the side
opposite to the sun and moon, in a direction
contrary to their attraction, is
what I am not able to account for.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> This difficulty will be removed
when you consider that all bodies
moving in circles have a constant tendency
to fly off from their centers. Now,
as the earth and moon move round their
center of gravity, that part of the earth
which is at any time opposite to the
moon will have a greater centrifugal
force than the side next her, and at the
earth’s center the centrifugal force exactly
balances the attractive force: therefore,
as much water is thrown off by
the centrifugal force on the side opposite
to the moon, as is raised on the side
next her by her attraction. Hence, it is
plain, that at D, fig. 3, the centrifugal force
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>must be greater than at the center E, and
at E than B, because the part D is farther
from the center of motion than the
part B. On the contrary, the part B
being nearer the moon than the center
E, the attracting power must there be
strongest, and weakest at D. And, as
the two opposing powers balance each
other at the earth’s center, the tides will
rise as high on that side from the moon,
by the excess of the centrifugal force, as
they rise on the side next her by the excess
of her attraction.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> In this explanation you have
mentioned nothing of the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> From what I have already
said it must be plain to you that if there
were no moon the sun by his attraction
would raise a small tide on the side next
him; and, it is as evident that the tides
opposite would be raised as high by the
centrifugal force: for the sun and earth,
as well as the earth and moon, move
round their center of gravity. This
may be exemplified by an easy experiment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Take a flexible hoop, suppose
of thin brass, tie a string to it and whirl
it round your head, and it will assume
an elliptical shape; the tightness of the
string drawing out the side next to your
hand, and the centrifugal force throwing
off the other.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This I clearly comprehend.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I shall now refer you to the
next figure, (fig. 4.) where F represents
the moon at full: the sun and moon are
in opposition, and yet the tide is as high
on each side as in the former case. I
wish you to shew me the cause.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I will use my endeavour to do
it, Sir.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Then I doubt not you will
accomplish it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> When the moon is at full,
ten parts of water are raised from that
side of the earth next her, by her attraction;
and, as the side which is next her
is opposite to the sun, three parts must be
thrown off by his centrifugal force, the
sum of which will be thirteen parts next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the moon.—From the side opposite to
the moon, and under the sun, ten parts
are thrown off by her centrifugal force,
and three raised by his attraction, making
thirteen, the same as before.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I could not have done it better.
These are called <i>Spring Tides</i>. But
when the moon is in her quarters, the
action of the sun and moon are in opposition
to each other; that is, they act
in contrary directions (see fig. 5.) The
moon of herself would raise the water ten
parts under her, and throw off ten parts
by her centrifugal force on the opposite
side; but, the sun being then in a line
with the low-water, his action keeps the
tides from falling so low there, and consequently
from rising so high under and
opposite to her. His power, therefore,
on the low-water being three parts,
leaves only seven parts for the high water,
under and oppose the moon. These
are called <i>Neap Tides</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This is very plain.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You would naturally suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>that the tides ought to be highest directly
under and opposite to the moon: that is,
when the moon is due north and south.
But we find, that in open seas, where the
water flows freely, the moon is generally
past the north and south meridian when
it is high-water. For, if the moon’s attraction
were to cease when she was past
the meridian, the motion of ascent communicated
to the water before that time
would make it continue to rise for some
time after: as the heat of the day is
greater at three o’clock in the afternoon
than it is at twelve; and it is hotter in
July and August than in June, when the
sun is highest and the days are longest.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> These are convincing reasons.
And, pray what time after the moon has
passed the meridian, is it high-water?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> If the earth were entirely
covered with water, so that the tides
might regularly follow the moon, she
would always be three hours past the meridian
of any given place when the tide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>was at the highest at that place. But,
as the earth is not covered with water,
the tides do not always answer to the
same distance of the moon from the meridian
at the same places, because the regular
course of the tides is much interrupted
by the different capes and corners
of the land running out into the oceans
and seas in different directions, and also by
their running through shoals and channels.
But, at whatever distance the moon
is from the meridian on any given day, at
any place, when the tide is at its height
there, it will be so again the next day,
much about the time when the moon
is at the like distance from the meridian
again.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Are not the tides later every
day than they were the preceding day?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Yes; and the reason is obvious:
for, whilst the earth is revolving
on its axis in twenty-four hours, the
moon will be advancing in her orbit;
therefore the earth must turn as much
more than round its axis before the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>place which was under her can come to
the same place again with respect to her,
as she has advanced in her orbit during
that interval of time, which is 50 minutes.
This being divided by 4, gives
12-1/2 minutes; so that it will be 6 hours
12-1/2 minutes from high to low-water, and
the same time from low to high-water:
or 12 hours 25 minutes from high-water
to high-water again.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> This I understand perfectly
well.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I have now finished my description
of the tides, and having a little
time to spare, if you wish to know how to
find the proportionate magnitude of the
planets with that of the earth, and to
calculate their distances from the sun, I
will employ it that way.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> At our first conference I remember
you shewed me the proportion
that the other planets bear to the earth,
with their periods and distances from the
sun; but to have it in my power to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the calculations myself, will certainly give
me great pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> To find what proportion any
planet bears to the earth; or, that one
globe bears to another, you must observe
that, <i>all spheres or globes are in proportion
to one another as the cubes of their diameters</i>.
So that you have nothing more to
do than to cube the diameter of each, and
divide the greatest by the least number,
and the quotient will shew you the proportion
that one bears to the other.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> The operation appears very
simple; but, as I do not know what a
cube number is, I cannot perform it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> You cannot forget what a
square number is.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> The product of any number
multiplied into itself is a square number,
as 4 is the square of 2.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Any square number multiplied
by its root, or first power, will be a
cube number. Thus 4 multiplied by 2
will be 8, which is the cube of 2; 9 is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>square or second power, and 27 the cube
or third power of 3, &amp;c. This you will
perhaps better understand by</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I do, Sir; and am now prepared
for an example.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The diameter of the sun is
893552 miles, of the earth 7920 miles;
how much does the sun exceed the earth
in magnitude?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> The cube of 893522, the sun’s
diameter, is 713371492260872648; and
of 7920, the earth’s, 496793088000.
And 713371492260872648 divided by
496793088000 is equal to 1435952, and
so many times is the bulk of the sun
greater than that of the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> This one example may suffice,
as I intend by and by to give you a table
of diameters, &amp;c.; you may then calculate
the rest at your leisure.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I shall now, Sir, be glad to
have the other explained.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The periods of the planets,
or the times they take to complete their
revolutions in their orbits, are exactly
known; and the mean distance of the
earth from the sun has been also ascertained.
Here, then, we have the periods
of all, and the mean distance of one, to
find the distances of the rest; which may
be found by attending to the following
proportion:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As the square of the period of any one planet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is to the cube of its mean distance from the sun;</div>
      <div class='line'>So is the square of the period of any other planet,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the cube of its mean distance.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The cube root of this quotient will be
the distance sought.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Here again I find myself at a
loss, as I have not learnt to extract the
cube root.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> I will give you <a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a>Doctor
Turner’s rule, which I think will answer
your purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>“First, having set down the given number,
or resolvend, make a dot over the unit
figure, and so on over every third figure
(towards the left hand in whole numbers,
but towards the right hand in decimals);
and so many dots as there are, so many
figures will be in the root.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next, seek the nearest cube to the first
period; place its root in the quotient, and
its cube set under the first period. Subtract
it therefrom; and to the remainder
bring down one figure only of the next
period, which will be a dividend.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, square the figure put in the quotient,
and multiply it by 3, for a divisor.
Seek how often this divisor may be had
in the dividend, and set the figure in the
quotient, which will be the second place
in the root.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, cube the figures in the root, and
subtract it from the two first periods of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the resolvend; and to the remainder
bring down the first figure of the next
period, for a new dividend. Square the
figures in the quotient, and multiply it by
3, for a new divisor; then proceed in
all respects as before, till the whole is
finished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Point every third figure, and the first
period will be 15; the nearest cube to
which, in the table I gave you just now,
you will find to be 8, and its root 2; the
8 you must place under the 15, and the 2
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>in the quotient: take 8 from 15 and 7
will remain, to which bring down 6, the
first figure of the next period, and you
have 76 for a dividend. The figure put
in the quotient is 2, the square of which
is 4, which multiplied by 3 is 12, for a
divisor. Now 12 in 76 will be 5 times;
cube 25, and you will have 15625, which,
subtract from the resolvend, and nothing
will remain; which shews that the resolvend
is a cube number, and 25 its root.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> You say 12 in 76 is 5 times; I
should have said 6 times.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> In common division it would
be so; but as the cube of 26 would be
greater than the resolvend from which
you are to subtract it, it can go but 5
times.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> Now, Sir, I think I have a
sufficient knowledge of the rule to solve a
problem.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> The earth’s period is 365
days, and its mean distance from the sun
95 millions of miles; the period of Mercury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>is 88 days—what is his mean distance?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> As the distance of the earth is
given, I must make the square of 365 the
first term, the cube of 95 the second, and
the square of 88 the third term of the
proportion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> Certainly.—Take your slate,
or a piece of paper, prepare your numbers,
and make your proportion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil.</span> I find the square of 365 =
133225; of 88 = 7744; and the cube of
95 = 857375.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then 133225 : 857375 :: 7744 to a fourth term.</p>

<p class='c009'>I now multiply the second and third
terms together, and divide the product
by the first, the quotient 49836 is the
cube of the mean distance of Mercury
from the sun in millions of miles, and the
fourth term sought.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Tutor.</span> So far you are right. Now

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
